# Number Guessing Game

A simple and interactive Python game where users must guess a randomly selected number within a specified range.

---

## 📝 Description

The **Number Guessing Game** asks the user to choose a number range (between 1 and 100), then challenges them to guess a secret number within that range. After each guess, the program informs the user whether their guess is too low, too high, or correct. The game tracks the number of attempts needed to guess the number.

## 🚀 Features

- Feedback after each guess ("Too low", "Too high", "Correct!")
